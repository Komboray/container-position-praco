This is a simple project that makes it easy for the user to generally understand the positioning of a div container
That is a relative position is the actual position of the container when a div is set with a backgroud
Relative position is the position to the far left, we can start placing the container to the far left of the container using things like align items top-left in css and so on
Absolute is placing a container on the relative position within another container
